We are a research group working on the algorithmic foundations of machine learning for healthcare and other high-risk domains. Our work combines probabilistic modeling and deep learning to develop uncertainty-aware and interpretable AI methods that support robust decision-making in clinical workflows, in close collaboration with domain experts.
